PSLV or Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle is the rocket that has made India proud on various occasions, be it launching 104 satellites or accomplishing Mangalyaan, it has been nothing less than a shining beacon of India’s engineering capabilities. What are the innovations that power this excellent machine? What makes it so reliable? We will find answers to these questions in this article.

# PSLV : Habitual to creating history.

Today PSLV is the go-to vehicle for most of ISRO’s missions and the fantastic mission record of PSLV speaks for itself. Let us have a look at the statistics to have an overview about how good the record is for PSLV.

1. Launches (till 11/10/2020) – 50 
2. Failures – 2
3. Partial Failures – 1

Memorable Launches
- PSLV Launched 104 Satellites together in 37th launch setting record of largest number of satellites placed in orbit by a single rocket launch.
- PSLV Launched Mangalyaan in its 25th launch. The mission was successful and it made India first country to have a successful mars mission in first try.
- In the 11th mission PSLV launched Chandrayaan 1 which was India’s first lunar mission and placed indian flag on the lunar south pole.

PSLV has a record of providing superb performance in crucial missions without any hiccups and its constant success proves the reliability of the machine.So, let’s have a look at how this amazing machine works.

# PSLV : How it works

PSLV is a multistage rocket with 4 stages each powered differently, it stands 44m tall and can carry 320 tonnes of payload into orbit.

## First Stage

First stage of PSLV is powered by solid strap-on boosters and a S139 Solid rocket motor. Despite low efficiency of solid engines the rocket motor and strap-on boosters are solid powered because solid fuel powered engines provide best lift capacity which is necessary to provide enough thrust to lift a rocket from the launch pad.

- Fuel used – HTPB (Hydroxyl-Terminated Polybutadiene)
- Thrust produced (Solid Engine)– 4800 kN by 138 tonnes of fuel.
- Thrust Produced (Strap-on Boosters)– 719 kN

## Second Stage

The second stage of PSLV is powered by ingeniously innovated Vikas Liquid engine. This stage uses liquid fuel engines which provide controlled thrust for a long duration and hence, these stages are used to build up on the momentum and take the rocket out of the earth’s atmosphere after the solid stage has performed lift-off.

- Thrust – 799 kN
- Fuel used – UDMH and N2O4 (Dimethylhydrazine)

## Third Stage

Third stage is a small solid fuel stage which operates after the rocket is effectively out of the atmosphere. This stage is used to provide velocity necessary to achieve the orbit.

- Thrust – 490 kN
- Fuel used – HTPB (Hydroxyl-Terminated Polybutadiene)

## Fourth Stage

The fourth stage is made of two liquid stage engines which are responsible for placing the satellite in the orbit. Having two engines is necessary to increase the control over the thrust provided, this is done because the final stage requires high precision and greater control over thrust value to place the payload in the correct orbit. 
Also, having two engines with different thrust values provides more options to control the overall thrust value.

- Thrust – 7.6/2 kN
- Fuel used - MMH /MON (monomethylhydrazine / Mixed oxides of nitrogen)

# PSLV : Usage

The versatility of PSLV arises from its design, it enables the launch vehicle to place satellites in sun synchronous orbits as well as Geosynchronous transit orbit. This multi orbit operation capability of PSLV has proven to be useful as the rocket has been used to launch an array of satellites to Low earth orbit and Geostationary orbits.

The respective payload capacities are GTO – 1425 kg and SSPO – 1750 kg.

Thanks to the flexible design the launch vehicle has been re-configured many times as per needs and was used to launch the Indian Remote Sensing satellites series, the IRNSS series which is used for navigation purposes and the Cartosat satellites used for cartography.

# Conclusion

The PSLV has been at the center of most crucial missions for India’s space program and it continues to perform its duty even after over 50 missions. It is now being re-configured to launch medium weight satellites into a range of orbits and the vehicle has become an example of how engineering can solve the most difficult problems in an efficient manner.

I hope that after reading this article you have gained some new knowledge and you will appreciate the efforts of Indian scientists even more.
